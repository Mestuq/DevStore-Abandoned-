# DevStore - best place to organize your next GameJam!
This website is pretty old already, and **abandoned (My hosting stopped working in 2019)**, but i decided to publish it here anyway, because someone meybe would like to continue developing this website.
Years ago my InnoDB database had very slow connection with hosting, so most of user data functionalities of the website was stored into files like ".json" in the hosting hard drive. It is not the best idea, but I had no choice back then.
Anyway, this website is pretty fun. It's have a lot of functionalities, as shown below.
Database Dump is in main folder "DATABASE SQL id10128563_login.sql".
